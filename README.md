# PlanTCP

Very simple Swift TCP client. Functional, but not yet documented.

See the playground (TCPSample.playground) for information.

*We personally don't use this library anymore. It was created for [MongoKitten](https://github.com/PlanTeam/MongoKitten) but since then we have moved to other libraries. Feel free to use it or base something else on this, but know that it may not be fully tested or up to date with the latest Swift standards.*
